Planet Money MP3 scraper

Download all of the Planet Money MP3s.

Honestly this program is pretty fragile and requires you already have a
list of URLs to scrape from which you can get from the Planet Money
podcast archive, and the MP3s it downloads aren't tagged correctly. Just
needed something that worked.

The program downloads to the current directory by default; if you want to
specify another directory, pass it as an argument to the script, e.g.

    python scraper.py $DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY
